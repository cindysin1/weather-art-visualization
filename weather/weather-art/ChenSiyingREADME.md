# Weather Art Visualization

This project collects weather data and transforms it into an artistic visualization using Python. The goal is to explore the boundary between data visualization and generative art.

## Features
- Fetches weather data from an online API
- Processes and cleans the data
- Creates a creative, artistic visualization (static or animated)

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script in `src/` to fetch data and generate the visualization

## Project Structure
- `data/` — stores raw and processed data
- `src/` — source code for data collection, processing, and visualization
- `.github/` — project instructions and workflow
